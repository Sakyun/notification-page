## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


### What I learned

How to use typescript with the  context api and the types. Still unsure about the type for useReducer.


### Continued development

- I'd probably replace the css with styled components.
- I could find a way to optimize re-rendering as well because when toggling to unread all items are re rendered.
- Instead of importing data, I could mock a database with json web server ?
- Add some tests.
